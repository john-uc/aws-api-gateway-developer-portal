# Getting Started

## Setting up Your UniCourt Developer Portal

A developer account provides you with an API Key for accessing our APIs, a playground for trying out our APIs, and API usage metrics. To start using the portal please follow the below steps.


### 1. Login to Your UniCourt Developer Portal

- To use any of our APIs you must login to your UniCourt Developer Portal.
- Login using the `Sign In` button in the top right.

### 2. Try out Our APIs
- Navigate to [APIs](/apis) and find the API you want.

- Use the `Try it out` feature to get examples of the request and response shapes of our APIs. 

- This makes an API call to the backend service using your API Key and provides a sample curl request with all necessary input parameters and the real response.


### 3. Monitor Your Usage

 - You can monitor your usage towards the limits on [your Dashboard.

Depending on the API configuration, subscribing to one API may subscribe you to several APIs. These APIs may have related functionality or share a pricing plan. Requests against any of these APIs will be counted together in your usage.
