# Getting Started

## Setting up the Developer portal 

A developer account provides an API Key for accessing our APIs, a playground for testing our APIs, and API usage metrics. To start using the portal please proceed as follows

### 1. Log into the UniCourt Developer Portal
- To use any of our APIs you must login to our Developer portal. 
- Sign in using the buttons in the top right.

### 2. Subscribe to required API
- After you have logged into the portal, navigate to [My  Dashboard](/dashboard), you will have a new API Key created for you but it won't be linked to any of our APIs.


- To activate it for a particular API, navigate to [APIs](/apis) and find the API you want.

- Click `subscribe`. Your API Key is now subscribed to the API and you can make calls to its methods.

### 3. Try out the API's
- Navigate to [APIs](/apis) and find the API you want.

- Use the `Try it out!` feature to get examples of the request and response shapes of our APIs. This makes an API call to the backend service using your API Key and provides a sample `curl` request with all necessary input parameters and the real response.


### 4. Monitor your usage
 - You can monitor your usage towards the limits on [your dashboard](/dashboard). 
 


Depending on the API configuration, subscribing to one API may subscribe you to several APIs. These APIs may have related functionality or share a pricing plan. Requests against any of them will be counted together in your usage. 
 
This is currently in Alpha stage and a few customers of UniCourt are provided access to try it out. If you are an existing customer and would like to get access please [contact us.](https://unicourt.com/contact-us)
